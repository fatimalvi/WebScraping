The main python file is called "Project3.0.py"

Before you run the file you need to download beautifulsoup4, requests and Tkinter.

You can do this by going to terminal and typing the following two sentence 

pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 install requests

The Tkinter library comes default.

This is the website we used to understand how Tkinter works along with some Youtube videos


For Web Scraping we used the following Video to understand how everything works

We've used two different websites which are both included in the code

Since it's our first web scraping it takes a little time to run the files since we're both very new at it. The wins, losses and other basketball functions take about 10 minutes to create an output since its going through a very large input

In the start it'll take around 1 minutes and 40 seconds for the program to start working.
